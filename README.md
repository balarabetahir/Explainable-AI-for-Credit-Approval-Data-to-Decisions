# Explainable-AI-for-Credit-Approval-Data-to-Decisions
Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and tools that make AI model decisions understandable and transparent to both developers and end-users.
# Explainable AI for Credit Approval

This project explores the application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to credit approval processes using the HELOC dataset. The goal is to improve transparency and interpretability for three key stakeholders: data scientists, loan officers, and customers.

## Key Themes

1. **The Need for XAI in Finance**  
   - AI models must be transparent, especially in sensitive areas like finance.  
   - XAI helps build trust, ensure fairness, and comply with regulations.

2. **HELOC Dataset**  
   - Contains anonymized credit applications with financial attributes.  
   - Used to predict credit risk and support loan approval decisions.

3. **Stakeholder Perspectives**  
   - **Data Scientists**: Focus on model validation, fairness, and compliance. Use rule-based models like BRCG and LRR.  
   - **Loan Officers**: Need relatable, actionable explanations. Use example-based methods like Protodash.  
   - **Customers**: Require clear, straightforward explanations. Use contrastive explanations (pertinent positives/negatives).

4. **XAI Techniques**  
   - **BRCG**: Generates simple "if-then" rules for classification.  
   - **LRR**: Combines rules with numerical data for probabilistic predictions.  
   - **Protodash**: Identifies prototypical examples to explain decisions.  
   - **Contrastive Explanations**: Pertinent negatives show minimal changes to flip a decision; pertinent positives highlight key factors for approval.

## Objectives
- Set up an environment for XAI methods on the HELOC dataset.  
- Apply XAI techniques tailored to different stakeholders.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of XAI in enhancing transparency for credit decisions.

## Conclusion
XAI provides a framework for making AI-driven credit decisions more transparent, fair, and understandable. By addressing the needs of data scientists, loan officers, and customers, it promotes trust and effective use of AI in finance.
